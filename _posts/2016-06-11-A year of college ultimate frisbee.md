One of the reasons why I chose USC was because of solid ultimate scene there. This was one of the best opportunities for me to improve my ultimate skills. I immediately signed up for the mailing list waiting to join the action. It started with intramurals, which is like a hat tournament having more emphasis on learning. This encourages people who are interested in ultimate to get a sense of how the game is played. We had a lot of fun, met ton of people.
         
After that the try outs for the college team happened. It was a month long thing, where everyone is evaluated on various parameters like speed, stamina and disc handling skills. We had a lot of people in the tryouts and everyone was good. I honestly didn't think I would make it to the A team (Lockdown), but fortunately I did. I was put in the defense team **cough** obviously because of my layout D's **cough**. Fall semester was like a growth phase for us. We had practice from 9PM to 12:30AM thrice a week. Yes, we did have amazing dedicated coaches. I so love playing in the floodlights and turf.

We did go to a few tournaments in Irvine and friendlies in LA. This helped build the team chemistry. There were also these occasional football pregame grill and beer pong!!!

One of the biggest beach tournament [Leiout](http://leiout.com/) happens in Santa Monica every year. It was like a chill tournament for us. We had a lot of fun in the sand, leing-out.

This officially marked our end of off season. Time to get serious. We were determined to move up the ranking this season. We went to several tournaments like SoCal warmups, Stanford qualifiers, Trouble in Vegas, Sectionals and Regionals where did reasonably good. It sometimes gets very physical when comparing to how we play in India. We unfortunately could not qualify for nationals. Maybe next time.

It was great playing with everyone. I learnt a ton of things on the field and off. 
Next year I am determined to improve my game even more. I just hope that I don't plagued by injury.
